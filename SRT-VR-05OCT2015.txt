SRT-VR-05OCT2015: Comodo Chromodo_Setup.exe Multiple DLL Planting Race Conditions Allow LEoP

Severity:
MEDIUM (Local EoP)


Systems Affected:
* Comodo Chromodo < v48.12.18.238
* Comodo Dragon < v48.12.18.243
NOTE: Chromodo included and set as default browser in default installations of Comodo Internet Security
   - Tested Against 8.2.0.4703


Description:
A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists within Chromodo's update process that could allow 
a user to gain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM level permission. This vulnerability is also due to a combination 
of several insecure practices.

Chromodo is set as the default browser upon installed Comodo Internet Security (CIS), and goes so 
far as even replacing Google Chrome shortcuts with Chromodo on the desktop and Start Menu. While 
this vulnerability is not necessarily part of the CIS code base, from our testing, it came along for
the ride and puts default unpatched CIS installations at risk.

  
Technical Description:
Updates for Comodo's browser, Chromodo, are performed automatically or whenever a user launches the 
browser and goes to the "About Chromodo" option and selects update browser. In the former case, no
user interaction is requested or required ; in the later, the user must agree to the update.

Chromodo Updates are downloaded and stored in the insecure folder C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Temp\NSX###.TMP path 
(where as # represent a random number and X is a random letter).   This folder by default has 
writeable permissions by the currently logged in user.

C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F
                                 BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)F
                                 DESKTOP-PRABIAQ\User:(OI)(CI)F

Updates are initially checked by the SYSTEM service C:\Program Files (x86)\Comodo\Chromodo\chromodo_updater.exe.
This service is auto executed on system start by the registry key - HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\ChromodoUpdater.

After this binary determines a update is available it will download and copy the update, as well as 
chromodo_setup.exe, to the C:\Windows\Temp\ folder.  This binary is then executed with SYSTEM level 
privileges with the command line "C:\Windows\temp\chromodo_setup.exe --silent".  However the current 
directory and the other components of the update are both set to C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\nsX###.tmp 
folder.

Upon updating, the Chromodo_Setup.exe will create this temp nsX###.tmp folder and begin file 
extraction from \Windows\Temp\ to this folder.  

During this time the following DLL files are extracted to the insecure User's Temp folder and can 
be hijacked:
- System.dll
- DragonPlugin.dll
- SecureDNSPlugin.dll
- InstallHelperPlugin.dll
- AccessControlW.dll
- NsJSON.dll

A local attacker can then create an application to monitor the C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\ 
folder for any creation of the temp folders.  When an update is available, the application can then 
beat the race condition and then plant a malicious DLL in the folder before the legitimate DLL is 
copied.  These DLL files are then loaded at SYSTEM level privileges into Chromodo_Update.exe, 
however after gaining elevated privileges the malicious attacker should migrate to a new process, 
write another file, or stay persistent so the application can install the legit DLL in order to 
prevent a failed Chromodo update.


Mitigation / Protection:
Upgrade your affected software suites to the following or greater:
* Comodo Dragon v48.12.18.243
* Comodo Chromodo v48.12.18.238
