SRT-VR-02OCT2015: Comodo Setup_CLPS_CLIENT_TRANSACTION_RELEASE DLL Search Order Hijack LEoP

Severity:
MEDIUM (Local EoP)


Systems Affected:
* Comodo GeekBuddy < 4.25.167
  - Included in Comodo Internet Security 2016 (Tested Against 8.2.0.4703)


Description:
A local privilege elevation vulnerability exists within Comodo GeekBuddy 2016 that allows a local 
user account to elevate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The vulnerability is due to 
multiple poor security practices within the Comodo Security Suite.


Technical Description:
GeekBuddy stores several helper applications within the C:\ProgramData\Comodo\lps4\temp folder.
These binaries are individual components of the Comodo Security Suite and are executed whenever
their related function is performed, updated, or uninstalled.

The directory listing is as follows:

The C:\ProgramData\Comodo\lps4\temp\ folder has the following permission configuration:

C:\ProgramData\Comodo\lps4\temp NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(ID)F
                                BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(ID)F
                                CREATOR OWNER:(OI)(CI)(IO)(ID)F
                                BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(ID)R
                                BUILTIN\Users:(CI)(ID)(special access:)
                                                      FILE_WRITE_DATA
                                                      FILE_APPEND_DATA
                                                      FILE_WRITE_EA
                                                      FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES

Notice how the folder allows Users to have FILE_WRITE_DATA and FILE_WRITE_EA access.  This allows 
non-administrator users the ability to create files in the directory but not delete or modify 
existing files.

Comodo's main service engine is controlled by the SYSTEM service Launcher-Service.exe which resides
in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\COMODO\ folder.  This service is auto launched by the 
registry key HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\CLPSLauncher

This binary will then launch Unit_Manager.exe in the C:\Program Files\COMODO\GeekBuddy with SYSTEM 
level privielges.  This binary in turn then launches the binary C:\Program Files\COMODO\GeekBuddy\unit.exe 
to handle each sub process in the C:\ProgramData\Comodo\lps4\temp\ folder.

During client connections to update servers and Geek Buddy executions the unit.exe binary will 
launch the binary setup_clps_client_transaction_release-4.19.365037.89.exe.  This setup binary has 
hardcoded DLL loading procedures to look for SHFOLDER.DLL in the current directory which it is 
executed from.

.data:00409240                 dd offset aShfolder     ; "SHFOLDER"
.data:00409244                 dd offset aShgetfolderpat ; "SHGetFolderPathA"

During this delay load procedure the exe will load SHFOLDER.DLL from its local directory before 
looking in the other PATHS variables.

By planting a malicious SHFOLDER.DLL in the C:\ProgramData\Comodo\lps4\temp\ and triggering an 
update or client connection to secure servers (which occurs automatically at user login) a user can 
elevate their privileges to SYSTEM and compromise the system fully.
