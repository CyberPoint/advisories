SRT-VR-12NOV2015: BitDefender Enterprise arrakis3 Stack Overflow RCE
 
Severity:
High (Unauthenticated RCE)
 
 
Systems Affected:
BitDefender GravityZone Server (prior to 5.1.23-472)
BitDefender Endpoint Security Clients (prior to 5.3.26.746)
BitDefender Endpoint Security Tools Clients (prior to 6.2.6.670)
 
 
Description:
Arrakis is a custom HTTP server used to distribute updates to connected clients of the GravityZone 
server. This arrakis3 web server is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow that can result in 
remote code execution as the executing user. This vulnerability affects all BitDefender management 
installations, as well as any endpoint installations with the "relay" option enabled.
 
 
Technical Description:
Arrakis Web Server is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. When a request packet of size 
> 0x4000 bytes is sent to a listening server (TCP/7074), the stack is corrupted with user-controlled 
data. This is due to an unchecked buffer size when processing the HTTP client request. This can 
result in remote code execution without credentials.
On the GravityZone server, this user is the "bitdefender" user. While this is an unprivileged user 
(non-root), it does offer many opportunities to infect connecting clients as this service has access 
to all GravityZone services.
On GravityZone Endpoint Security clients configured to act as relays, the process is named 
differently ("EPUpdateServer.exe" on win32) and runs as SYSTEM/root.
 
The following disasm snippet is from the patched version of arrakis3:
  mov     rdx, [rbp+0]
  cdqe
  mov     rcx, [rdx+rax*8]
  cmp     qword ptr [rcx+4800h], 0   ;test to ensure size is ngt 0x4800 (poor man's strlen check)
  jz      loc_2024F
  mov     [rsp+458h+var_40], 400h
  mov     rax, [rdx+rax*8]
  mov     rsi, r13
  mov     rdx, r14
  mov     rdi, [rax+4800h]           ;deref same buffer that was checked
  mov     rax, [rdi]
  call    qword ptr [rax+20h]        ;process request -> boom
 
This patch, albeit not a standard way to check for the string length, does enforce a buffer no more 
than 0x4800 bytes in length.
 
 
Mitigation / Protection:
Upgrade your affected software suites to the following or greater:
* GravityZone: 5.1.23-472 (19NOV2015)
* Endpoint Security: 5.3.26.746 (25NOV2015)
* Endpoint Security Tools: 6.2.6.670 (17NOV2015)
