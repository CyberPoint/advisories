SRT-VR-07OCT2015: Comodo Chromodo_Setup.exe DLL Search Order Hijack LEoP & Browser Injection

Severity:
Moderate (DLL Hijack / Injection)


Systems Affected:
* Comodo Internet Security < 8.2.0.4978


Description:
A local privilege elevation vulnerability exists within Chromodo's update process that could allow a 
user to get NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM level permissions.
This vulnerability also allows a malicious local application to inject arbitrary code into the 
Chromodo browser process upon startup.  This could be abused my malware in order to remain 
persistent within the same memory space of Chromodo Browser in order to monitor or tamper a user's 
web browsing habits and activities. 


Technical Description:
Comodo's Chromodo browser, Chromodo.exe, and it's update service, Chromodo_Setup.exe, both suffer 
from a DLL search order hijacking vulnerability due to the insecure usage of LoadLibraryEx 
attempting to load 'cmdshim32.dll'
Both binaries call LoadLibraryExW using the dwFlags parameter set to 0x08. 

.text:004023DE loc_4023DE:                            
.text:004023DE                 push    8               ; dwFlags
.text:004023E0                 push    0               ; hFile
.text:004023E2                 push    ebx             ; lpLibFileName
.text:004023E3                 call    ds:LoadLibraryExW
.text:004023E9                 mov     [ebp+lParam], eax
.text:004023EC                 test    eax, eax
.text:004023EE                 jz      loc_402481

When the dwFlags value is set to 0x08, LoadLibraryExW will execute LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH 
behavior.  This behavior causes both of these binaries to perform DLL searches across the system 
using the currently installed user's PATH environment variable.

This allows a local attacker or malicious application to abuse the insecure LoadLibraryExW call by 
first adding a read/writable folder to the current user's PATH environment variable.  The attacker 
would then drop a malicious DLL named 'cmdshim32.dll' into this folder.
Upon starting Chromodo.exe the maliciously planted cmdshim32.dll is loaded and allows an attacker to 
be resident within the browser.
Additionally during a Chromodo update, the ChromodoUpdater service will also load this cmdshim32.dll 
from the same location, allowing a malicious user or malicious application to elevate their 
privileges to SYSTEM.


Mitigation / Protection:
Upgrade your affected software suites to the following or greater:
* Comodo Internet Security v8.2.0.4978
