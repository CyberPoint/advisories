SRT-VR-24DEC2015: Microsoft Windows PhoneInfo.dll DLL Hijack Vulnerability

Severity:
Moderate (DLL Hijack)


Systems Affected / Tested:
Microsoft Windows 10


Description:
Microsoft Windows 10 appears to be vulnerable to an insecure DLL Loading vulnerability that could 
allow attackers to perform a DLL hijack or sideload attack that could allow arbitary code to execute 
on the vulnerable machine.  Arbitrary code will often execute in the context of the current user, 
however in some scenarios (dependeing on the implementation and privileges of the calling software), 
this could potentially result in remote code execution or privilege escalation.


Technical Description:
The vulnerability appears to originate within the file, URLMON.dll, and is exposed by the API call 
BuildUserAgentStringMobileHelper in which the dynamic-link-library phoneinfo.dll is loaded by a 
LoadLibraryEx call in two locations:
.text:000000018003BC82 loc_18003BC82:                          
; CODE XREF: BuildUserAgentStringMobileHelper(UACOMPATMODE,char *,USERAGENT_TYPE,int)+73C
.text:000000018003BC82                 mov     r12d, dword ptr [rsp+5F0h+var_5A0+4]
.text:000000018003BC87                 cmp     r12d, 2
.text:000000018003BC8B                 jz      loc_18003BFF1
.text:000000018003BC91                 mov     r15d, 1
.text:000000018003BC97                 cmp     r12d, 3
.text:000000018003BC9B                 jz      loc_18003BD8B
.text:000000018003BCA1                 mov     rsi, cs:qword_1801480A8
.text:000000018003BCA8                 mov     [rbp+510h+MultiByteStr], 0
.text:000000018003BCAC                 test    rsi, rsi
.text:000000018003BCAF                 jnz     short loc_18003BCF3
.text:000000018003BCB1                 xor     r8d, r8d        ; dwFlags
.text:000000018003BCB4                 lea     rcx, LibFileName ; "phoneinfo.dll"
.text:000000018003BCBB                 xor     edx, edx        ; hFile
.text:000000018003BCBD                 call    cs:__imp_LoadLibraryExW

                         and

.text:000000018003BDA1 loc_18003BDA1:                          
; CODE XREF: BuildUserAgentStringMobileHelper(UACOMPATMODE,char *,USERAGENT_TYPE,int)+A4E
.text:000000018003BDA1                 xor     r8d, r8d        ; dwFlags
.text:000000018003BDA4                 lea     rcx, LibFileName ; "phoneinfo.dll"
.text:000000018003BDAB                 xor     edx, edx        ; hFile
.text:000000018003BDAD                 call    cs:__imp_LoadLibraryExW

In both vulnerable circumstances, LoadLibraryEx is called using dwFlags set to 0x00, thus performing 
the same search pattern defined by DLLSearchOrder and LoadLibrary.
Microsoft does not appear to install phoneinfo.dll within Microsoft Windows 10 desktop editions, 
therefore when LoadLibraryEx is called, the SafeDLLSearchOrder  search is performed.  

This will perform a standard file search on the following directories in order:
1.) The directory specified by lpFileName.
2.) The system directory. Use the GetSystemDirectory function to get the path of this directory.
3.) The 16-bit system directory. There is no function that obtains the path of this directory, but 
it is searched.
4.) The Windows directory. Use the GetWindowsDirectory function to get the path of this directory.
5.) The current directory. **Exploitable**
6.) The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable. Note that this does not 
include the per-application path specified by the App Paths registry key. The App Paths key is not 
used when computing the DLL search path. **Exploitable**

When the search has reached #5 and #6 of the order, an attacker with limited privileges could 
potentially hijack the search and provide a malicious phoneinfo.dll file which would get loaded by 
the calling application.  

Exploitation:
In order to exploit these vulnerable functions, an attacker can target one of two code paths, the 
first section of code is reachable in this manner:
_____________________________________________________
CINetHttpEdge::SetOptionUserAgent OR
CINetHttp::SetOptionUserAgent OR
CIEBrowserModeFilter::collectCacheEntryInfoCallback
_____________________________________________________
            |
            V
MapBrowserEmulationStateToUserAgent (Ordinal 445)
            |
            V
InitUserAgentGlobals (Ordinal 492)
            |
            V
BuildUserAgentStringMobileHelper
 
While the second vulnerable LoadLibraryEx call is obtainable by this alternative code path:
_____________________________________________________
ObtainUserAgentString (Ordinal 211) OR
GetUserAgentString
_____________________________________________________
            |
            V
InitUserAgentGlobals (Ordinal 492)
            |
            V
BuildUserAgentStringMobileHelper

Based on the vulnerable function calls and their cross references, it appears the most commonly 
exposed vulnerable code path would be exposed by the ObtainUserAgentString API call.
This call has the following layout:

HRESULT ObtainUserAgentString(
  _In_  DWORD  dwOption = 0,
  _Out_ LPCSTR *pcszUAOut,
  _Out_ DWORD  *cbSize
);

Exploitation can be confirmed by calling this API call and monitoring the attempted library load of 
phoneinfo.dll through the SafeDLLSearchOrder locations.

During investiation, CyberPoint SRT discovered the following Microsoft applications which call the 
vulnerable URLMON.DLL functions are as follows:
- Internet Explorer
    At startup without parameters (ie double clicking and launching IE)
- Skype
    At startup (will perform persistent attempts to load this library)
- OneDrive
    During synchronization and updates (without user interaction)
- Visual Studio 2015
    During Microsoft account update or synchronization.
 
In these scenarios an attacker could only gain programmatic access to the memory contents of these 
applications - potentially intercepting Skype conversations, accessing OneDrive data, monitoring 
internet activites within IE,  potentially modifying source code in Visual Studio products, or 
abusing any of these to become persistent on the local machine.

Since the vulnerability originates within URLMON.DLL, any application performing UserAgent 
modification requests using URLMON.DLL are also potentially vulnerable.  This includes many 3rd 
party applications, installers, and services.  Exploitation of these third party applications could 
pontentially allow information disclosure, arbitrary code execution, system persistence,  
elevation of privileges, or remote code execution.


Mitigation / Protection:
Apply the Microsoft supplied patch MS16-014 released on 09FEB2016.
